# 1. Curves, Classes and Modules

The proposed solution has as input parameters a list with all the points (initial, final and control) that going to define the Bezier curve, so we can change it whenever we want to recalculate the mentioned curve. In addition, the implementation consider more order curves, deppending on the list of points received. For example, if we receive 2 points, the Bezier curve would be a straight line because the points are the start and final.
