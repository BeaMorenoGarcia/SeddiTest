# 3. Picking Geometry

To know where the pointer is, we use "onmouseover" event, which is launched when the pointer is over an html element, calls a function to which we can pass as an attribute the html element, a variable or whatever we want, to operate it from the controller.
We can also CSS style the element with the pseudo class ": hover".

Being dynamic (not static) and non-linear, the data structure that I would use would be trees, since it greatly reduces the possibilities and that will favor the  framerate dropping.
